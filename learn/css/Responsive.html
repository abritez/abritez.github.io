			<p>Life was so easy back when you needed you walk over to a computer "surf" the internet. Sure there were some cross browsers issues, but as a designer your canvas was relatively straight forward. A person, sitting down  infront of a computer, with a keyboard infront of them and mouse in their hand.</p>
			<p>Flashforward a couple decades, and it is hard to find anything that doesn have some sort of graphical user interface. From watches to glasses, the web comes in all shapes and sizes.  As time pushes forward we could no longer design for a specific device in an omni channel world</p>
			<p>A student sets down her waffle and coffee on top of a breakfast table in her living room.  She quickly skim her course assignment list to see what she needs to work on.  She notices that there is a whiteboard video that her professor would like her to view. She tries to watch it on her phone, but decided she wants a larger screen. She clicks the ChromeCast button on her mobile browser and within seconds the video is playing on the TV infront of her.  Unfortunetly, this video is a bit longer than she anticipated and she needs to catch the bus to get onto campus. She decided to shut down the ChromeCast session and rush out the door.</p>
			<p>Less than a half hour has past and she is sitting on the bus flipping through social media on her phone to see what her friends were up to last night. She suddenly remembers that she still has 5 minututes left to watch on the video, so pulls up her laptop and locates her phone's mobile hot spot. Shortly after she finds the video which has convenietly defaulted to were she left off earlier that morning.</p>
